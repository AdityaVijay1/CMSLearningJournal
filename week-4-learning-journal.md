# Goal: Setting up a local host WordPress site using XAMPP 

In the past weeks, I made a simple informational site using online web hosting Content Management System platforms such as hosting through Joomla.org, infinityfree and Amazon Web Services Lightsail.
This week, I explored setting up a full WordPress site locally using XAMPP to allow for more customization flexibility as it is a platform that furnishes a suitable environment to test and verify the working of projects.

I set up a local WordPress site by:
1) Installing XAMPP to create a local Apache server <br>
2) Configuring MySQL database and PHPMyAdmin <br>
3) Downloading and installing WordPress in the XAMPP htdocs folder <br>
4) Running the WordPress installer to set up site pages and admin dashboard <br>

Setting up a local WordPress environment entails harmonizing different technologies to craft a comprehensive solution. Beyond just hosting a site, this more robust infrastructure centralizes control for engaging website administration, developing custom functionality, and streamlining operations. Embracing a local XAMPP-WordPress platform guarantees more autonomy, continuity, and a unique edge for customization.

Hosting locally allows you complete control over the software configurations, versions, and web server settings without relying on a third party hosting provider's limitations.Maintaining your own local server avoids the recurring hosting costs associated with paying for remote hosting or cloud servers. This is a budget-friendly setup. A local server allows you to mimic and test production-style deployments during development. You can evaluate integrations, optimizations etc. in isolation.
