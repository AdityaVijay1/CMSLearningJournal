# Goal: Setting up a local host WordPress site using XAMPP 

In the past weeks, I made a simple informational site using online web hosting Content Management System platforms such as hosting through Joomla.org, infinityfree and Amazon Web Services Lightsail.
This week, I explored setting up a full WordPress site locally using XAMPP to allow for more customization flexibility as it is a platform that furnishes a suitable environment to test and verify the working of projects.

I set up a local WordPress site by:
1) Installing XAMPP to create a local Apache server <br>
2) Configuring MySQL database and PHPMyAdmin <br>
3) Downloading and installing WordPress in the XAMPP htdocs folder <br>
4) Running the WordPress installer to set up site pages and admin dashboard <br>

Setting up a local WordPress environment entails harmonizing different technologies to craft a comprehensive solution. Beyond just hosting a site, this more robust infrastructure centralizes control for engaging website administration, developing custom functionality, and streamlining operations. Embracing a local XAMPP-WordPress platform guarantees more autonomy, continuity, and a unique edge for customization.

Hosting locally allows you complete control over the software configurations, versions, and web server settings without relying on a third party hosting provider's limitations.Maintaining your own local server avoids the recurring hosting costs associated with paying for remote hosting or cloud servers. This is a budget-friendly setup. A local server allows you to mimic and test production-style deployments during development. You can evaluate integrations, optimizations etc. in isolation.

<br>

- Content Management Systems <br>
Editing backend database through phpMyAdmin allows easy content updates
Creating pages and posts with varying fields improved WP admin skills
Upskilling to use CMS more dynamically expanded employability

The hands-on, practical nature of facing real problems enriched learning significantly over just theory. Tackling technical challenges to build locally-run WP site greatly boosted confidence.
The process gave hands-on experience with stacks like Apache, MySQL and expanding technical skills in CMS architecture. Troubleshooting configuration issues also enriched learning. This local site foundation paves way for more tailored sites.

# Setup Process
To establish a robust local web development environment, I installed XAMPP, an easy Apache distribution containing MySQL, PHP, and Perl. This integrated open-source stack will facilitate hosting sites and apps on my own computer for more flexibility.
After successfully installing XAMPP, I launched the Apache and MySQL modules to initialize the backend database system. Within phpMyAdmin, I created a new database instance locally to serve content to any sites I host from my machine henceforth.
With the Apache web server and MySQL database now configured, I downloaded WordPress, the popular content management system (CMS), into XAMPP’s htdocs directory. I executed WordPress’  installation to connect it to my local MySQL database just created so that WordPress can use it for storing and managing site information dynamically.
<br>
The local XAMPP-MySQL-WordPress installation now complete, I have a customizable infrastructure to develop WordPress sites. I can continually create new sites that will leverage the local database for content editing capabilities without relying on external hosting while retaining authorization over optimization, testing and expansion efforts.
