# Description of the Task


# Goal: Creating 2 Websites for a Coffee Business with the purpose of targeting a different audience with each one, which can be extremely useful for improving marketting and acquiring customers. 

The overarching goal of creating two distinct websites is to strategically expand brand reach, drive effective marketing campaigns, create and increase brand awareness and ultimately acquire a diverse customer base. The first website serves as a comprehensive platform to spread awareness on a broader scale, targeting audiences of all agesâ€”kids, young adults, students, and adults by catering to all of them, providing a variety of options. It functions as a versatile marketing tool to capture a wide demographic.

Simultaneously, the second website adopts a more focused approach by tailoring content to specific target audiences section exclusively designed for adults. This segmented strategy ensures a more personalized and engaging experience for this demographic which happens to be the largest customer base for coffee shops and cafes, increasing the likelihood of customer acquisition by aligning with their unique preferences and needs.

In essence, these two websites work synergistically to achieve the dual objectives of broad brand visibility and targeted engagement, catering to the distinct tastes and preferences of diverse audience segments. This approach is designed to maximize the impact of marketing efforts and foster long-term customer relationships across different age groups.

In my [Week 1 Website](https://adityavijay1.github.io/CMS-Week1/index.html), [Week 2 Website](https://adityavijaycms.cloudaccess.host/index.php) and [Week 3 Website](https://adityavijaycmsprac.cloudaccess.host/), I made them each with different goals that can help contribute to the overall success of a website for a business. From each of these, through research and practical work I have learnt a lot about the industry standard and the importance of brand awareness that can help increase results of a business. Combining my knowledge and experience of these practicals along with my extensive online research, I have used them to build the two websites.

This assignment helps create a: 
1) Defined target audience
2) A user-friendly website
3) Information about the business
4) Blogs and other details that provide information and entertainment 
5) Wide variety menu
6) Details about the business that can help increase visits to stores

In response to the evolving needs of the contemporary business environment, establishing an online presence for the coffee business becomes imperative. Crafting a website is a strategic move that aligns with the digital landscape's requirements, providing a multifaceted solution. This digital platform not only amplifies visibility but also acts as a dynamic hub for customer interaction, product display, and operational efficiency. Embracing a website ensures accessibility, convenience, and a distinctive market advantage.

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I have used a lot of information from the practical class and Professor James to understand more about Content Management Systems and the proper way to deliver a product and learnt a lot about Joomla.
I have spent several hours trying to understand how does Joomla work and how to make a website using it through the different types of components that it offers. I have also again viewed through multiple web hosting services to find the best ones that offer ease of access.

Web hosting services compared:
1) Hostinger
2) InfinityFree
3) SiteGround
4) GoogieHost
5) x10Hosting

Reasons why I chose InfinityFree:

1) Cost-Effective:
InfinityFree offers free hosting services, making it a budget-friendly option, especially for personal projects or small businesses.
SiteGround, Hostinger and the others have introductory prices, but they can increase upon renewal.

2) Ease of Use:
InfinityFree provides a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for beginners.
Whereas other options do offer user-friendly interfaces but may have more advanced features and some may also be locked behind a paywall.

3) Resource Limitations:
InfinityFree provides reasonable resources for small websites.
SiteGround and Hostinger offer better resources, but they come at a cost.

Note: For this week's practical, I opted to use the web hosting service offered by Joomla.org as it was suggested by Professor James as a good option to start Joomla with and my InfinityFree website required a few days to get verified so that I can use Joomla and Wordpress on it.
