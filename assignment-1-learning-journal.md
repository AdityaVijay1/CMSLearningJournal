# Description of the Task
Create 2 websites using 2 different Content Management Systems, both websites should be for the same idea/company but have different goals and targets. Showcasing the segmentation of a business and how it can be useful to increase a customer base.
<br>
# Goal: Creating 2 Websites for a Coffee Business with the purpose of targeting a different audience with each one, which can be extremely useful for improving marketting and acquiring customers. 

I have decided to make a website for a coffee shop/cafe business that is named Brews & Bubbles Bistro. The idea was born out of a passion of crafting exceptional coffee experiences. In this era of digital connectivity, a website for Brews & Bubbles Bistro is not merely a choice but a necessity. It's a virtual door that opens into the heart of  coffee culture, offering a space where enthusiasts can explore the rich history, diverse offerings, and distinctive charm of each location. The website becomes a portal for engagement, education, and celebration, bringing together a community that shares our love for the artistry and craftsmanship of a perfect cup of coffee. As Brews & Bubbles Bistro continues to grow, the website serves as a dynamic platform to connect with global audience, fostering a sense of belonging and excitement for all things brewed and bubbling.

The overarching goal of creating two distinct websites is to strategically expand brand reach, drive effective marketing campaigns, create and increase brand awareness and ultimately acquire a diverse customer base. The first website serves as a comprehensive platform to spread awareness on a broader scale, targeting audiences of all agesâ€”kids, young adults, students, and adults by catering to all of them, providing a variety of options. It functions as a versatile marketing tool to capture a wide demographic.

Simultaneously, the second website adopts a more focused approach by tailoring content to specific target audiences section exclusively designed for adults. This segmented strategy ensures a more personalized and engaging experience for this demographic which happens to be the largest customer base for coffee shops and cafes, increasing the likelihood of customer acquisition by aligning with their unique preferences and needs.

In essence, these two websites work synergistically to achieve the dual objectives of broad brand visibility and targeted engagement, catering to the distinct tastes and preferences of diverse audience segments. This approach is designed to maximize the impact of marketing efforts and foster long-term customer relationships across different age groups.

In my [Week 1 Website](https://adityavijay1.github.io/CMS-Week1/index.html), [Week 2 Website](https://adityavijaycms.cloudaccess.host/index.php) and [Week 3 Website](https://adityavijaycmsprac.cloudaccess.host/), I made them each with different goals that can help contribute to the overall success of a website for a business. From each of these, through research and practical work I have learnt a lot about the industry standard and the importance of brand awareness that can help increase results of a business. Combining my knowledge and experience of these practicals along with my extensive online research, I have used them to build the two websites.

This assignment helps create a: 
1) Defined target audience
2) A user-friendly website
3) Information about the business
4) Blogs and other details that provide information and entertainment 
5) Wide variety menu
6) Details about the business that can help increase visits to stores

In response to the evolving needs of the contemporary business environment, establishing an online presence for the coffee business becomes imperative. Crafting a website is a strategic move that aligns with the digital landscape's requirements, providing a multifaceted solution. This digital platform not only amplifies visibility but also acts as a dynamic hub for customer interaction, product display, and operational efficiency. Embracing a website ensures accessibility, convenience, and a distinctive market advantage.

## Learning Activities & Resources
During the assignment I have used plenty of information gained from Professor's perspective of my topic, class lecture, practical work done and a lot of articles and videos online to understand more about Content Management Systems, Joomla, WordPress and the proper way to deliver a product which serves its targeted purpose.
I have spent several hours trying to understand how does Joomla and WordPress work and how to make a website using it through the different types of components that both of them offer. I have also again viewed through multiple web hosting services to find the best ones that offer ease of access as the one I had found last week stopped working.

<br>
Web hosting services compared:
1) Hostinger
2) InfinityFree
3) SiteGround
4) Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Reasons why I chose AWS:

1) Reasonable Cost and Comfort:
Although there are free options such as InfinityFree  making it a budget-friendly option, it had a lot of problems regarding the security and the way of accessing the website.
SiteGround, Hostinger and Amazon Web Services do have introductory prices, however I chose Amazon Web Services as I found the ease of access to it was much better and allowed me to maintain both websites .

2) Ease of Use:
Amazon Web Services provides a user-friendly interface, making it possible to reach your domain with 2 simple clicks, extremely suitable for beginners.
Whereas other options do offer user-friendly interfaces but may have more advanced features which may confuse a beginner.

3) Resource Limitations:
InfinityFree provides limited resources for small websites.
SiteGround and Hostinger offer better resources, but they come at a cost.
Amazon Web Services provides a good amount of resources at a lower cost as compared to the others

For both websites, I have done paid hosting service for better resources and accessibility to ensure that the website can be well maintained and updated for the future with any changes that come about, which is crucial for Content Management Systems

I spent approximately 22 hours this week on Content Management System Assignment 1

# Content Insights
This week I learnt a lot of things related to Joomla, WordPress, Segmentation-Targetting-Positioning (STP) and the Four Ps (Product,Price,Place,Promotion) from the class lecture, practical work and online research. I created two different websites with different targeted goals based on the demographic of the business and created a website to specifically target a younger audience by providing a product line to their liking and a place for them to study, talk and meet with friends and the second website specifically targeting only adults, by providing them with a combination of coffee and smoking that has a huge customer base but not a lot of places that offer them. For this assignment, I had done plenty of research that has allowed me to learn a wide variety features and knowledge about Joomla and WordPress. 

For the Joomla Website, I had to learn a lot about the customization it offered and how I can use them to design and match my goal for the website to have an appropriate layout and designs. I had installed extensions that required me to learn a lot about as they each consisted of their own unique features.

Extensions and Plugins Used:
1) Slide Show Extension: Used for showcasing different slides that are extremely useful to gain attention to certain pages and highlight important points
2) Komento Extension: Used, so that users can leave comments on the websites.
3) Contact Us Form: Used, so that users can easily contact the business with any queries or feedback
4) Akeeba Backup: As I was experimenting with different plugins and extensions, I had to use this plugin so that I could reach my last saved point in case anything went wrong
<br>
For my WordPress Website, I had to learn a lot about WordPress in a short period of time, as I had only a little experience with it. The demographic chosen are the main customer base for this business and are highly important to be catered to, for the business and the website to be a success. I have learned a lot about the similarities and differences between Joomla and WordPress through this assignment.I have also utilized plugins for WordPress as well.

Extensions and Plugins Used:
1) Yoast SEO: Since this website, contains a lot of text, images and videos it is highly important to use an SEO to understand how the website would be scanned to help increase the chances of a user finding the website. Yoast SEO provides you with details and the SEO score of your page, using this information you can help make your website better
2) WooCommerce: I have attempted to setup a menu ordering system on the website, that can help add items to carts and check the total.
3) Akismet Anti-spam Spam Protection: Since the website has a blog page, this plugin helps prevent spam from happening and is very useful in filtering out unwanted messages.
