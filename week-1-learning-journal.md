## Content Insights
This week I learnt a lot of things related to CMS, Web Design and the IT industry from the class lecture, practical and online research.
I refreshed my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and also gained new and deeper insight into HTML and CSS through designing and customizing a website for my own coffee cafe/business and indulged in understanding new concepts I hadn't done before.
Furthermore, I gained insights into a web content management system, WordPress and Joomla through Youtube videos and online articles. I learned about the style of presentation and how to do so on WordPress.
Lastly, this week I had also learnt about Web hosting and the different platforms that can be used. Seeing the vast varieties of options, I had decided to opt for GitHub due to the following insights I gained about it through research:
1) Free Hosting: GitHub Pages offers free hosting for static websites, making it an economical choice.
2) Ease of Use: GitHub Pages is designed to be user-friendly, allowing developers to deploy their websites with minimal effort.
3) Version Control Integration: GitHub Pages seamlessly integrates with GitHub repositories, providing version control functionality. 
4) Custom Domain Support: GitHub Pages supports custom domains, enabling users to associate their projects with a personalized web address. 


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing this practical, I have refreshed and gained deeper and new knowledge in Web design within a limited time frame, indicating opportunities at growth and granting me the opportunity to seize career outcomes when it comes to Web Design, further increasing my employability. 
I have learnt more about the industry and what is expected, improved my skills in terms of focusing on design and delivery and not just solely on design as work would require consistent outputs. I learnt to manage my time more efficiently and cover the different aspects of a task within the given time and learn new concepts on the go. This week I did reach my SMART goal.
These practical tasks along with the lecture helped me take a more mature and logical approach towards the industry and is an extremely valuable life lesson that I learned.
