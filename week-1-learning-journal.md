## Content Insights
This week I learnt alot of things related to CMS, Web Design and the IT industry from the class lecture, practical and online research.
I refreshed my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and also gained new and more deeper insight into HTML and CSS through designing and customizing a website for my own coffee cafe/business and indulged in understanding new concepts I hadn't done before.
Furthermore, I gained insights into a web content management system, WordPress and Joomla through youtube videos and online articles. I learned about the style of presentation and how to do so on Wordpress.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing this practical, I have refreshed and gained deeper and new knowledge in Web design within a limited time frame, indicating opportunities at growth and granting me the opportunity to seize career outcomes when it comes to Web Design, further increasing my employability. 
I have learnt more about the industry and what is expected, improved my skills in terms of focusing on design and delivery and not just solely on design as work would require consistent outputs. I learnt to manage my time more efficiently and cover the different aspects of a task within the given time and learn new concepts on the go. 
These practical tasks along wiht the lecture helped me take a more mature and logical approach towards the industry and is an extremely valuable life lesson that I learned.
