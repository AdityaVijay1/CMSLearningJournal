# Goal: Creating a Website for a Coffee Business with the purpose of inviting/creating an atmosphere for the largest consumer base of the business who are adults, by adhering and advertising more towards them

In my [Week 2 Website](https://adityavijaycms.cloudaccess.host/), I focused on creating a website for a coffee business which can help increase brand awareness but I mainly targetted young adults and adults. 
This Week I made a website that targets the larger consumer base who are adults by:
1) Providing menu items/products to their liking
2) User-Friendly Website
3) Information and details about the business
4) Blogs and other details that provide information and entertainment 


Adapting to the dynamic demands of the modern business landscape necessitates the creation of an online footprint for our coffee business. Developing a website is a strategic step that harmonizes with the evolving digital realm, offering a comprehensive solution. This online platform goes beyond just increasing visibility; it serves as a dynamic center for engaging with customers, showcasing our products, and streamlining our operations. Embracing a website guarantees accessibility, convenience, and a unique edge in the market.

# SMART Goals for Coffee Business Website:

Menu Optimization: Regularly assess the popularity of menu items and optimize offerings based on customer feedback and sales data.
Introduce seasonal or thematic promotions to keep the menu fresh and enticing for adult customers.


- Measurable:
Increase online engagement from the targeted customer base by implementing features like contacting us, product menus, aiming for a 35% rise in website traffic within the first three months which can be measured through google site analytics and viewing active user numbers, content engagement (the specific web pages made for them as well), and feedback. Track user interactions, such as clicks, time spent on pages, and menu exploration, to assess user engagement.
