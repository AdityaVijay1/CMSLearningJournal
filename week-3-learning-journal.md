# Goal: Creating a Website for a Coffee Business with the purpose of inviting/creating an atmosphere for the largest consumer base of the business who are adults, by adhering and advertising more towards them

In my [Week 2 Website](https://adityavijaycms.cloudaccess.host/), I focused on creating a website for a coffee business which can help increase brand awareness but I mainly targetted young adults and adults. 
This Week I made a website that targets the larger consumer base who are adults by:
1) Providing menu items/products to their liking
2) User-Friendly Website
3) Information and details about the business
4) Blogs and other details that provide information and entertainment 


Adapting to the dynamic demands of the modern business landscape necessitates the creation of an online footprint for our coffee business. Developing a website is a strategic step that harmonizes with the evolving digital realm, offering a comprehensive solution. This online platform goes beyond just increasing visibility; it serves as a dynamic center for engaging with customers, showcasing our products, and streamlining our operations. Embracing a website guarantees accessibility, convenience, and a unique edge in the market.

# SMART Goals for Coffee Business Website:

- Specific:
Tailor site content including specialty coffee/tea drinks and fresh bakery items for target adult audience and develop a user-friendly website with dedicated sections adults keeping information concise and important.
Menu Optimization: Regularly assess the popularity of menu items and optimize offerings based on customer feedback and sales data.
Introduce seasonal or thematic promotions to keep the menu fresh and enticing for adult customers.


- Measurable:
Increase online engagement from the targeted customer base by implementing features like contacting us, product menus, aiming for a 35% rise in website traffic within the first three months which can be measured through google site analytics and viewing active user numbers, content engagement (the specific web pages made for them as well), and feedback. Track user interactions, such as clicks, time spent on pages, and menu exploration, to assess user engagement.


- Achievable: 
Ensuring that the website design and features align with the business's current capabilities and resources and is also catered towards the user's needs. Increasing brand awareness through a website. Keeping site architecture clean and intuitive for seamless navigation
Content Creation Schedule: Develop a content creation schedule for blogs, aiming for at least two engaging posts per week that align with adult interests and coffee culture.
Establish a user-friendly feedback mechanism to gather insights and preferences from adult visitors.


- Relevant:
Tailoring the website content to align with the coffee business's brand identity, values, and customer expectations. Ensuring that the information provided is relevant, up-to-date, and compelling.
Share blog content relevant to health-conscious working professionals
Implement localized engagement strategies for different store locations, considering regional preferences and events to make the website content relevant to the local adult audience.


- Time-bound:

Roll out promotional launch campaign focused on first month
Maintaining the website with updates, the aim for our business is to increase customer engagement and reduce the customer acquisition costs.

# Content Insights
This week I learnt a lot of things related to WordPress from the class lecture, practical and online research. I created a website to specifically target an adult audience by providing a product line to their liking and a place for them to relax and socialize.
This week's practical on WordPress provided a significant learning experience, allowing for the creation and customization of a website tailored to the coffee business. The process of working with WordPress unveiled a range of functionalities and tools specific to the content management system. Learning about WordPress's structure, plugins, and template customization provided valuable insights into efficient website management. Understanding how to navigate and optimize WordPress's features was particularly enlightening, as it opened up opportunities to efficiently present content and create an engaging online experience for the coffee business.

Through this week's practical and lecture I understood the need for tailoring content towards specific demographic to gain attention and awareness towards a brand and was an overall enlightening experience to have a mixture of design, information and technology.

# Group Formation
For the assignment 2 group project, this week, I conducted interviews with prospective teammates with the following questions:
1) What Skills should a good Web Developer have?
2) Are you aware of the roles and responsibilities of a Web Developer?
3) Can you list a few ways to speed up Page Loading?
4) State the difference between span tag and div tag in HTML 5.
6) While building a web application, how do you consider SEO, maintainability, UX, performance, and security?
7) Any past experience with CMS specifically WordPress
8) Preferred Web Hosting Site
9) Local or Online Host to do work?
10) best ways to communicate with you?
11) How often can you attend team meetings to discuss plans?

And here are the insights of the two teammates that I have chosen and formed a team with:

1) Albert Alvaro
2) Tan Ben Siang 

I have chosen these two as I liked their answers and their work ethic seems to match mine, I feel we would work well as a team and hence decided to form a team. However we are still looking for a 4th member for the team as well
