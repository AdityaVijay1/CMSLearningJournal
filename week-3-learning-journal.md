# Goal: Creating a Website for a Coffee Business with the purpose of inviting/creating an atmosphere for the largest consumer base of the business who are adults, by adhering and advertising more towards them

In my [Week 2 Website](https://adityavijaycms.cloudaccess.host/), I focused on creating a website for a coffee business which can help increase brand awareness but I mainly targetted young adults and adults. 
This Week I made a website that targets the larger consumer base who are adults by:
1) Providing menu items to their liking
2) User-Friendly Website
3) Information about the business
4) Blogs and other details that provide information and entertainment 

In response to the evolving needs of the contemporary business environment, establishing an online presence for the coffee business becomes imperative. Crafting a website is a strategic move that aligns with the digital landscape's requirements, providing a multifaceted solution. This digital platform not only amplifies visibility but also acts as a dynamic hub for customer interaction, product display, and operational efficiency. Embracing a website ensures accessibility, convenience, and a distinctive market advantage.

# SMART Goals for Coffee Business Website:

- Specific: Develop a user-friendly website with dedicated sections for both adults and children, showcasing a diverse product line for each audience along with brief details about the business that are clear and concise.

- Measurable: Increase online engagement by implementing features like contacting us, product menus, and online ordering, aiming for a 25% rise in website traffic within the first three months which can be measured through google site analytics and viewing active user numbers, content engagement (the specific web pages), and feedback.

- Achievable: Ensuring that the website design and features align with the business's current capabilities and resources and is also catered towards the user's needs. Increasing brand awareness through a website.

- Relevant:  Tailoring the website content to align with the coffee business's brand identity, values, and customer expectations. Ensuring that the information provided is relevant, up-to-date, and compelling.

- Time-bound: Set a realistic timeline for launching the website and establish milestones for ongoing updates, improvements, and marketing efforts to drive sustained growth and maintaining the website with updates, the aim for our business is to increase customer engagement and reduce the customer acquisition costs.

By adhering to SMART criteria, the coffee business can approach website development through Joomla, a Content Management System, with a strategic and goal-oriented mindset, enhancing its online presence and fostering a more connected and dynamic relationship with its customer base.

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I have used a lot of information from the practical class and Professor James to understand more about Content Management Systems and the proper way to deliver a product and learnt a lot about Joomla.
I have spent several hours trying to understand how does Joomla work and how to make a website using it through the different types of components that it offers. I have also again viewed through multiple web hosting services to find the best ones that offer ease of access.

Web hosting services compared:
1) Hostinger
2) InfinityFree
3) SiteGround
4) GoogieHost
5) x10Hosting

Reasons why I chose InfinityFree:

1) Cost-Effective:
InfinityFree offers free hosting services, making it a budget-friendly option, especially for personal projects or small businesses.
SiteGround, Hostinger and the others have introductory prices, but they can increase upon renewal.

2) Ease of Use:
InfinityFree provides a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for beginners.
Whereas other options do offer user-friendly interfaces but may have more advanced features and some may also be locked behind a paywall.

3) Resource Limitations:
InfinityFree provides reasonable resources for small websites.
SiteGround and Hostinger offer better resources, but they come at a cost.

Note: For this week's practical, I opted to use the web hosting service offered by Joomla.org as it was suggested by Professor James as a good option to start Joomla with and my InfinityFree website required a few days to get verified so that I can use Joomla and Wordpress on it.


# Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 13 hours this week on CMS
