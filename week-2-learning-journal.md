## Content Insights
This week I learnt a lot of things related to delivering a product, Segmentation-Targetting-Positioning (STP) and the Four Ps (Product,Price,Please,Promotion) from the class lecture, practical and online research.
This week's practical on joomla provided a significant learning experience, allowing for the creation and customization of a website tailored to the coffee business. The process of working with Joomla unveiled a range of functionalities and tools specific to the content management system. Learning about Joomla's structure, modules, and template customization provided valuable insights into efficient website management. Understanding how to navigate and optimize Joomla's features was particularly enlightening, as it opened up opportunities to efficiently present content and create an engaging online experience for the coffee business.


Web hosting services compared:
1) Hostinger
2) InfinityFree
3) SiteGround
4) GoogieHost
5) x10Hosting

Reasons why I chose InfinityFree:

1) Cost-Effective:
InfinityFree offers free hosting services, making it a budget-friendly option, especially for personal projects or small businesses.
SiteGround, Hostinger and the others have introductory prices, but they can increase upon renewal.

2) Ease of Use:
InfinityFree provides a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for beginners.
Whereas other options do offer user-friendly interfaces but may have more advanced features and some may also be locked behind a paywall.

3) Resource Limitations:
InfinityFree provides reasonable resources for small websites.
SiteGround and Hostinger offer better resources, but they come at a cost.

Note: For this week's practical, I opted to use the web hosting service offered by Joomla.org as it was suggested by the Professor as a good option to start Joomla with and my InfinityFree website required a few days to get verified so that I can use Joomla and Wordpress on it.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing this practical, I have refreshed and gained deeper and new knowledge in Web design within a limited time frame, indicating opportunities at growth and granting me the opportunity to seize career outcomes when it comes to Web Design, further increasing my employability. 
I have learnt more about the industry and what is expected, improved my skills in terms of focusing on design and delivery and not just solely on design as work would require consistent outputs. I learnt to manage my time more efficiently and cover the different aspects of a task within the given time and learn new concepts on the go. This week I did reach my SMART goal.
These practical tasks along with the lecture helped me take a more mature and logical approach towards the industry and is an extremely valuable life lesson that I learned.
