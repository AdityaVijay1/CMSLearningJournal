# Use of Learning Journal 

This learning journal serves as a reflective tool, documenting the journey of acquiring new skills, insights, and experiences during this week's practical tasks. It provides a platform to track learning activities, estimate the time invested, gain content insights, and reflect on career, employability, and learning perspectives.

# Description of the Task
Understanding and creating child theme for popular default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two and customizing the CSS code for changing the appearance
<br>
# Goal: Develop a comprehensive understanding of child themes in WordPress and apply this knowledge to create a customized child theme for the Twenty Twenty Two parent theme, improving the website's aesthetics and user response system and engagement.

The main goal of this week's practical task is to understand the concept of child themes and the  of using it appropriately to maintain a website in the sense that, despite development is going on the website's functionality is not disturbed and continues to function as intended while upgrades or updates are first tested out on child theme and once everything is confirmed and works then it can be deployed.

Acquire in-depth knowledge of WordPress child themes, focusing on their role in server maintenance. Utilize this understanding to construct a tailored child theme for the Twenty Twenty Two parent theme, enhancing the website's visual appeal and user engagement.

In essence, child themes are extremely important in a real-world scenario for constant development and deployment. 

In my past practicals, I had done all my work using online web hosting services that provide the service of Joomla and WordPress. Last week I had setup my local host and WordPress on it, so this week adding onto it, I learnt about child themes and the importance of them and customization of CSS code on the local host setup.

Hosting locally allows you complete control over the software configurations, versions, and web server settings without relying on a third party hosting provider's limitations.Maintaining your own local server avoids the recurring hosting costs associated with paying for remote hosting or cloud servers. This is a budget-friendly setup. A local server allows you to mimic and test production-style deployments during development. Can evaluate integrations, optimizations etc. in isolation.

# SMART Goals for Child Theme Customization :

- Specific: 
Create a child theme named "Twenty Twenty-Two Child" for the parent theme Twenty Twenty-Two <br>
Enqueue CSS stylesheet properly to override parent styles <br>
Make 6 specific CSS modifications for elements like header, fonts, colors and spacing <br>

- Measurable: 
Successfully activate child theme without breaking site functionality. Quantitatively validate CSS changes like font sizes, spacing by inspecting pages relative to previous values.

- Achievable: 
Overcome challenges related to coding and uploading the child theme, ensuring it is functional,  effective while iteratively testing modifications.

- Relevant:
Mastering the creation of child themes allows visually customizing client websites powered by WordPress in a non-destructive manner so updates to core themes remain intact.
Apply the learned concepts to improve the visual appeal and user response system of the website.

- Time-bound: 
Finish setting up child theme file/folder infrastructure.
Do customizations while checking and comparing the different outputs.

<br>
Web hosting services compared:<br>
1) Hostinger<br>
2) InfinityFree<br>
3) SiteGround<br>
4) Amazon Web Services (AWS)<br>
<br>
Reasons why I chose AWS:

1) Reasonable Cost and Comfort:
Although there are free options such as InfinityFree  making it a budget-friendly option, it had a lot of problems regarding the security and the way of accessing the website.
SiteGround, Hostinger and Amazon Web Services do have introductory prices, however I chose Amazon Web Services as I found the ease of access to it was much better and allowed me to maintain both websites .

2) Ease of Use:
Amazon Web Services provides a user-friendly interface, making it possible to reach your domain with 2 simple clicks, extremely suitable for beginners.
Whereas other options do offer user-friendly interfaces but may have more advanced features which may confuse a beginner.

3) Resource Limitations:
InfinityFree provides limited resources for small websites.
SiteGround and Hostinger offer better resources, but they come at a cost.
Amazon Web Services provides a good amount of resources at a lower cost as compared to the others

For both websites, I have done paid hosting service for better resources and accessibility to ensure that the website can be well maintained and updated for the future with any changes that come about, which is crucial for Content Management Systems


# Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 10 hours this week on Practical 5 Tasks 

# Content Insights
This week I learnt a lot of things related to Joomla, WordPress, Segmentation-Targeting-Positioning (STP) and the Four Ps (Product,Price,Place,Promotion) from the class lecture, practical work and online research. I created two different websites with different targeted goals based on the demographic of the business and created a website to specifically target a younger audience by providing a product line to their liking and a place for them to study, talk and meet with friends and the second website specifically targeting only adults, by providing them with a combination of coffee and smoking that has a huge customer base but not a lot of places that offer them. For this assignment, I had done plenty of research that has allowed me to learn a wide variety features and knowledge about Joomla and WordPress. 

For the Joomla Website, I had to learn a lot about the customization it offered and how I can use them to design and match my goal for the website to have an appropriate layout and designs. I had installed extensions that required me to learn a lot about as they each consisted of their own unique features.

Extensions and Plugins Used:
1) Slide Show Extension: Used for showcasing different slides that are extremely useful to gain attention to certain pages and highlight important points.
2) Komento Extension: Used, so that users can leave comments on the websites.
3) Contact Us Form: Used, so that users can easily contact the business with any queries or feedback.
4) Akeeba Backup: As I was experimenting with different plugins and extensions, I had to use this plugin so that I could reach my last saved point in case anything went wrong.
5) Progress Bar: To help increase the visual appearance and highlight the different goals of the business, I used progress bars which make it easier to quickly view and understand the content
<br>
For my WordPress Website, I had to learn a lot about WordPress in a short period of time, as I had only a little experience with it. The demographic chosen are the main customer base for this business and are highly important to be catered to, for the business and the website to be a success. I have learned a lot about the similarities and differences between Joomla and WordPress through this assignment.I have also utilized plugins for WordPress as well.

Extensions and Plugins Used:
1) Yoast SEO: Since this website, contains a lot of text, images and videos it is highly important to use an SEO to understand how the website would be scanned to help increase the chances of a user finding the website. Yoast SEO provides you with details and the SEO score of your page, using this information you can help make your website better
2) WooCommerce: I have attempted to setup a menu ordering system on the website, that can help add items to carts and check the total.
3) Akismet Anti-spam Spam Protection: Since the website has a blog page, this plugin helps prevent spam from happening and is very useful in filtering out unwanted messages.
