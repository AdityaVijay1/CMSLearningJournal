# Description of the Task
Understanding and creating child theme for popular default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two and customizing the CSS code for changing the appearance
<br>
# Goal: Develop a comprehensive understanding of child themes in WordPress and apply this knowledge to create a customized child theme for the Twenty Twenty Two parent theme, improving the website's aesthetics, user response system and engagement.

The main goal of this week's practical task is to understand the concept of child themes and the  of using it appropriately to maintain a website in the sense that, despite development is going on the website's functionality is not disturbed and continues to function as intended while upgrades or updates are first tested out on child theme and once everything is confirmed and works then it can be deployed.

Acquire in-depth knowledge of WordPress child themes, focusing on their role in server maintenance. Utilize this understanding to construct a tailored child theme for the Twenty Twenty Two parent theme, enhancing the website's visual appeal and user engagement.

In essence, child themes are extremely important in a real-world scenario for constant development and deployment. 

In my past practicals, I had done all my work using online web hosting services that provide the service of Joomla and WordPress. Last week I had setup my local host and WordPress on it, so this week adding onto it, I learnt about child themes and the importance of them and customization of CSS code on the local host setup.

Hosting locally allows you complete control over the software configurations, versions, and web server settings without relying on a third party hosting provider's limitations.Maintaining your own local server avoids the recurring hosting costs associated with paying for remote hosting or cloud servers. This is a budget-friendly setup. A local server allows you to mimic and test production-style deployments during development. Can evaluate integrations, optimizations etc. in isolation.

Successfully activate child theme without breaking site functionality. Quantitatively validate CSS changes like font sizes, spacing by inspecting pages relative to previous values.

- Achievable: 
Overcome challenges related to coding and uploading the child theme, ensuring it is functional,  effective while iteratively testing modifications.

- Relevant:
Mastering the creation of child themes allows visually customizing client websites powered by WordPress in a non-destructive manner so updates to core themes remain intact.
Apply the learned concepts to improve the visual appeal and user response system of the website.

- Time-bound: 
Finish setting up child theme file/folder infrastructure.
Do customizations while checking and comparing the different outputs.



## Learning Activities & Resources
I dedicated time this past week actively studying child themes and then applying those concepts to build a custom child theme for the Twenty Twenty-Two WordPress theme.

I studied details around: <br>
Relationship between parent themes and child themes in WordPress. Child themes allow users to override and adapt certain parts of the parent theme like visual styles, fonts, colors etc without modifying the source code. This is achieved by using proper specificity in CSS.
Making changes to style rules in child CSS overriding parent styling safely, however I faced a lot of issues with setting up the child theme due to an error when uploading and activating the theme, which took a lot of time to troubleshoot as due to the lack of resources online on that topic.
