# Content Insights
## I had come up with multiple theories for the different aspects of a WordPress Workflow and I could test them out in the group project and here are the results:

Multiple small tests were conducted across the different aspects of the WordPress workflow based along the hypothesis:

The team project provided a real-world opportunity to implement and test various aspects of the WordPress development workflow. Through systematic testing and observation, I aimed to validate hypotheses related to communication, role definition, project management, coding standards, testing, security practices, and performance optimization.

Project management tools significantly improved coordination, aiding in task breakdown and management, ultimately contributing to goal attainment.

Despite time constraints, adherence to coding standards was successfully maintained, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensible codebase. Testing and quality assurance practices, especially through Varying Vagrants Vagrant, identified issues early, facilitated continuous integration, and elevated overall code quality. Security practices, including HTTPS implementation and SSL certificates, notably enhanced the website's security. While exact load time improvements weren't quantifiable, the focus on SEO plugins and optimized media content suggested potential enhancements in site performance. Effective deployment tools and automation for backups and site security were identified as crucial for overall site improvement. 

I can say that the experiment done was a success as it helped verify the the initial theory about why a WordPress Workflow is important, it can be further improved in the following ways:

1) Larger sample size that is, a bigger group to see how it functions and enables collaboration
2) Longer time period, seeing how following the workflow over a longer period of time could yield results 
3) More strict adherence to the workflow
